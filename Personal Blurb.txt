I was introduced to the internet as an awkward and solitary teenager in the final years of the 1990s, back when the internet screamed at you through the phone lines and being online meant being at an IRL location. Those early days shaped me into the person I am today. The web back then was clumsy, quirky, and a little cringey—much like myself—but it also held incredible potential. Programmers and designers were stitching together a new world, and I was hooked.

This past year, I’ve been diving headfirst into that world, learning new languages and technologies at a rapid pace. I’ve worked extensively with CSS and JavaScript on personal projects (check out my portfolio below) and am currently building several ASP.NET Entity Framework applications. I bring a mix of robust talents and experiences to the table, and I’ve taken to the field quickly. For more details, feel free to explore my CV or GitHub repositories.

I’m open to work, but I’m also a huge fan of the cooperative and communal spirit that built the internet. If you’re interested in collaboration or just want to chat about tech, creativity, or the good old days of dial-up, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can email me at [your email] or connect with me on [platform]. Let’s build something amazing together!
